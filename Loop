In Python, a loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true or until a specific number of iterations are completed.

Types of Loops in Python
for Loop
Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).

while Loop
Used to execute a block of code as long as a given condition is True.

Loop Control Statements
break: Exits the loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next
pass: Does nothing; acts as a placeholder.



#for loop, #while loop, 
#break
#continue


# number=[1,2,3,4,5]

# for num in number:
#     if num==4:
#         continue
#     print(num)



# number=1
# while number<=15:
#     if number==5:
#         continue
#     print(number)
#     number+=1     #increment add(counts)



number=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

for num in number:
    if num % 2 ==0:
        print(f"{num}is even")



for loops are best for iterating over sequences.
while loops are used when the number of iterations is not predetermined.
Loops can be nested, meaning one loop inside another.
