Arithmetic operators in Python are used to perform mathematical operations between two operands.

Explanation:
Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second, resulting in a float.
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division.
Exponentiation (**): Raises the first number to the power of the second.
Floor Division (//): Divides the first number by the second and rounds down to the nearest whole number.


example:
# Addition

var=45
var2=50
var3= var+var2
print("addition:",var3)

sub=var-var2
print("subtraction:",sub)

print("Multiplication:", var*var2)
print("division:", var/var2)
print("modulus:", var%var2)
print("exponent:", var**var2)
print("floordivision:", var//var2)

example2
a = 10
b = 3

print("Addition:", a + b)           # 13
print("Subtraction:", a - b)        # 7
print("Multiplication:", a * b)     # 30
print("Division:", a / b)           # 3.333...
print("Modulus:", a % b)            # 1
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)    # 1000
print("Floor Division:", a // b)    # 3


#logical operator

name=True
name1=False

result= name and name1  #both operands are true then only it meets the condition and returns true

print("logical and:", result)
print("Logical OR:", name or name1)  #returns true if at least one operand is true

#reverse the logical state of the operand

a=True
result2=not a
print("logical not:", result2)

a=10
b=5
c=15

if a>b and c>a:
    print("both conditions are true")
if a<b or c>b:
    print("at leaste one condition is true")
if not(a<b):
    print("a is not less than b")

2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
Used to compare two values.

a = 10
b = 20

# Equal to (==)
print(a == b)  # False, because 10 is not equal to 20

# Not equal to (!=)
print(a != b)  # True, because 10 is not equal to 20

# Greater than (>)
print(a > b)   # False, because 10 is not greater than 20

# Less than (<)
print(a < b)   # True, because 10 is less than 20

# Greater than or equal to (>=)
print(a >= b)  # False, because 10 is not greater than or equal to 20

# Less than or equal to (<=)
print(a <= b)  # True, because 10 is less than or equal to 20

output
-------
False
True
False
True
False
True


#assignment operators
'''
+= add and assign
-=  sub and assign
*=  multiply and assign
/=  divid and assign
//=  floor divide and assign
**=  exponent and assign

'''
x=10
x += 5
x+5
print("x = ", x)
