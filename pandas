Basic data structures in pandas
Pandas provides two types of classes for handling data:

1. series: a one-dimensional labeled array holding data of any type
such as integers, strings, Python objects etc.
eg:
In [3]: s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 9])

In [4]: s
Out[4]: 
0    1.0
1    3.0
2    5.0
3    NaN
4    6.0
5    9.0
dtype: float64

2. DataFrame: a two-dimensional data structure that holds data like a two-dimension array or a table with rows and columns.
